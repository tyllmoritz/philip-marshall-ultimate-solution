# Marshall Solver

A static website that solves the Rubik's Cube with [Philip Marshall's method](https://www.helm.lu/cube/MarshallPhilipp/)
and animates the solution with [cubing.js](https://js.cubing.net/cubing/).

## The method

Everything is built from two series:

| Series | Moves | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Edge Piece Series | `F R' F' R` | cycles 3 edges (corners are collateral) |
| Corner Piece Series | `U R U' L' U R' U' L` | cycles 3 corners, edges untouched |

Steps: 1. cross, 2. center-section edges, 3. top edges, 4. five corners, 5. end game.

`src/engine/solver.js` builds a table of every distinct "preliminary turn + setup + series + undo setup"
(all 24 cube orientations, both directions, setups up to 2 turns). Each step repeatedly applies the
cheapest table entry that places more pieces without disturbing finished ones; if none exists it
finishes with a two-entry meet-in-the-middle lookup. The cross search also tracks quarter-turn parity,
since the series are even permutations. All six cross faces are tried and the shortest result is kept.

This is an independent implementation (average about 57-60 moves), not a transcription of the original write-up.

## Develop

```sh
npm install
npm run dev     # local dev server
npm test        # solves random scrambles, verifies the result
npm run build   # static site in dist/
```

Pushing to `main` deploys `dist/` to GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
(set Settings -> Pages -> Source to "GitHub Actions").
